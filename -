       This  section  explains  prominent concepts and notations in the set of
       high-level S3 commands provided.

   PPaatthh AArrgguummeenntt TTyyppee
       Whenever using a command, at least one path argument must be specified.
       There are two types of path arguments: LLooccaallPPaatthh and SS33UUrrii.

       LLooccaallPPaatthh: represents the path of a local file or directory.  It can be
       written as an absolute path or relative path.

       SS33UUrrii: represents the location of a S3 object, prefix, or bucket.  This
       must  be  written in the form ss33::////mmyybbuucckkeett//mmyykkeeyy where mmyybbuucckkeett is the
       specified S3 bucket, mmyykkeeyy is the specified S3 key.  The path  argument
       must  begin with ss33:://// in order to denote that the path argument refers
       to a S3 object. Note that prefixes are separated  by  forward  slashes.
       For  example, if the S3 object mmyyoobbjjeecctt had the prefix mmyypprreeffiixx, the S3
       key would be mmyypprreeffiixx//mmyyoobbjjeecctt, and if the object  was  in  the  bucket
       mmyybbuucckkeett, the SS33UUrrii would be ss33::////mmyybbuucckkeett//mmyypprreeffiixx//mmyyoobbjjeecctt.

       SS33UUrrii  also supports S3 access points. To specify an access point, this
       value must be of the form ss33::////<<aacccceessss--ppooiinntt--aarrnn>>//<<kkeeyy>>. For for  exam-
       ple  if  the  access  point  mmyyaacccceessssppooiinntt  to  be  used  has  the ARN:
       aarrnn::aawwss::ss33::uuss--wweesstt--22::112233445566778899001122::aacccceessssppooiinntt//mmyyaacccceessssppooiinntt   and   the
       object  being  accessed has the key mmyykkeeyy, then the SS33UURRII used must be:
       ss33::////aarrnn::aawwss::ss33::uuss--wweesstt--22::112233445566778899001122::aacccceessssppooiinntt//mmyyaacccceessssppooiinntt//mmyykkeeyy.
       Similar  to  bucket  names, you can also use prefixes with access point
       ARNs        for         the         SS33UUrrii.         For         example:
       ss33::////aarrnn::aawwss::ss33::uuss--wweesstt--22::112233445566778899001122::aacccceessssppooiinntt//mmyyaacccceessssppooiinntt//mmyypprree--
       ffiixx//

       The higher level ss33 commands do nnoott support access point  object  ARNs.
       For      example,      if      the     following     was     specified:
       ss33::////aarrnn::aawwss::ss33::uuss--wweesstt--22::112233445566778899001122::aacccceessssppooiinntt//mmyyaacccceessss--
       ppooiinntt//oobbjjeecctt//mmyykkeeyy   the   SS33UURRII   will   resolve  to  the  object  key
       oobbjjeecctt//mmyykkeeyy

       Every command takes one or two positional path  arguments.   The  first
       path  argument represents the source, which is the local file/directory
       or S3 object/prefix/bucket that is being referenced.   If  there  is  a
       second path argument, it represents the destination, which is the local
       file/directory or S3 object/prefix/bucket that is  being  operated  on.
       Commands  with only one path argument do not have a destination because
       the operation is being performed only on the source.

   SSiinnggllee LLooccaall FFiillee aanndd SS33 OObbjjeecctt OOppeerraattiioonnss
       Some commands perform operations only on single files and  S3  objects.
       The following commands are single file/object operations if no ----rreeccuurr--
       ssiivvee flag is provided.

          +o ccpp

          +o mmvv

          +o rrmm

       For this type of operation, the first path argument, the  source,  must
       exist  and be a local file or S3 object.  The second path argument, the
       destination, can be the name of  a  local  file,  local  directory,  S3
       object, S3 prefix, or S3 bucket.

       The  destination  is  indicated  as a local directory, S3 prefix, or S3
       bucket if it ends with a forward slash or back slash.  The use of slash
       depends  on  the  path argument type.  If the path argument is a LLooccaall--
       PPaatthh, the type of slash is the separator used by the operating  system.
       If  the  path  is a SS33UUrrii, the forward slash must always be used.  If a
       slash is at the end of the destination, the destination file or  object
       will  adopt the name of the source file or object.  Otherwise, if there
       is no slash at the end, the file or object will be saved under the name
       provided.  See examples in ccpp and mmvv to illustrate this description.

       Some commands only perform operations on the contents of a local direc-
       tory or S3 prefix/bucket.  Adding or omitting a forward slash  or  back
       slash  to the end of any path argument, depending on its type, does not
       affect the results of  the  operation.   The  following  commands  will
       always result in a directory or S3 prefix/bucket operation:

       +o ssyynncc

       +o mmbb

       +o rrbb

       +o llss

       Currently, there is no support for the use of UNIX style wildcards in a
       command's  path  arguments.   However,  most  commands  have  ----eexxcclluuddee
       ""<<vvaalluuee>>""  and  ----iinncclluuddee  ""<<vvaalluuee>>""  parameters  that  can achieve the
       desired result.  These parameters perform pattern  matching  to  either
       exclude  or include a particular file or object.  The following pattern
       symbols are supported.

          +o **: Matches everything

          +o ??: Matches any single character

          +o [[sseeqquueennccee]]: Matches any character in sseeqquueennccee

          +o [[!!sseeqquueennccee]]: Matches any character not in sseeqquueennccee

       Any number of these parameters can be passed to a command.  You can  do
       this  by  providing  an ----eexxcclluuddee or ----iinncclluuddee argument multiple times,
       e.g.  ----iinncclluuddee ""**..ttxxtt"" ----iinncclluuddee ""**..ppnngg"".   When  there  are  multiple
       filters,  the rule is the filters that appear later in the command take
       precedence over filters that appear earlier in the command.  For  exam-
       ple, if the filter parameters passed to the command were

          --exclude "*" --include "*.txt"

       All  files  will  be  excluded from the command except for files ending
       with ..ttxxtt  However, if the order of the filter parameters  was  changed
       to

          --include "*.txt" --exclude "*"

       All files will be excluded from the command.

       Each  filter  is evaluated against the ssoouurrccee ddiirreeccttoorryy.  If the source
       location is a file instead of a directory, the directory containing the
       file is used as the source directory.  For example, suppose you had the
       following directory structure:

          /tmp/foo/
            .git/
            |---config
            |---description
            foo.txt
            bar.txt
            baz.jpg

       In the command aawwss ss33 ssyynncc //ttmmpp//ffoooo ss33::////bbuucckkeett// the  source  directory
       is  //ttmmpp//ffoooo.   Any  include/exclude filters will be evaluated with the
       source directory prepended.  Below are several examples to  demonstrate
       this.

       Given  the directory structure above and the command aawwss ss33 ccpp //ttmmpp//ffoooo
       ss33::////bbuucckkeett// ----rreeccuurrssiivvee ----eexxcclluuddee ""..ggiitt//**"", the files ..ggiitt//ccoonnffiigg  and
       ..ggiitt//ddeessccrriippttiioonn  will be excluded from the files to upload because the
       exclude filter ..ggiitt//** will have the source  prepended  to  the  filter.
       This means that:

          /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/.git/config       (matches, should exclude)
          /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/.git/description  (matches, should exclude)
          /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/foo.txt  (does not match, should include)
          /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/bar.txt  (does not match, should include)
          /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/baz.jpg  (does not match, should include)

       The  command  aawwss  ss33  ccpp  //ttmmpp//ffoooo// ss33::////bbuucckkeett// ----rreeccuurrssiivvee ----eexxcclluuddee
       ""bbaa**"" will exclude //ttmmpp//ffoooo//bbaarr..ttxxtt and //ttmmpp//ffoooo//bbaazz..jjppgg:

          /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/.git/config      (does not match, should include)
          /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/.git/description (does not match, should include)
          /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/foo.txt          (does not match, should include)
          /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/bar.txt  (matches, should exclude)
          /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/baz.jpg  (matches, should exclude)

       Note that, by default, _a_l_l _f_i_l_e_s _a_r_e _i_n_c_l_u_d_e_d.  This means that provid-
       ing  oonnllyy  an  ----iinncclluuddee  filter  will not change what files are trans-
       ferred.  ----iinncclluuddee will only re-include files that have  been  excluded
       from an ----eexxcclluuddee filter.  If you only want to upload files with a par-
       ticular extension, you need to first exclude all files, then re-include
       the files with the particular extension.  This command will upload oonnllyy
       files ending with ..jjppgg:

          aws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.jpg"

       If you wanted to include both ..jjppgg files as well as ..ttxxtt files you  can
       run:

          aws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive \
              --exclude "*" --include "*.jpg" --include "*.txt"
