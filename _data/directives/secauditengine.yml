name: SecAuditEngine
description: Configures the audit logging engine.
syntaxis: SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly
default: "Off"
version: 1.0
data: |
  The SecAuditEngine directive is used to configure the audit engine, which logs complete transactions. ModSecurity is currently able to log most, but not all transactions. Transactions involving errors (e.g., 400 and 404 transactions) use a different execution path, which ModSecurity does not support.

  The possible values for the audit log engine are as follows:

  * **On:** log all transactions
  * **Off:** do not log any transactions
  * **RelevantOnly:** only the log transactions that have triggered a warning or an error, or have a status code that is considered to be relevant (as determined by the SecAuditLogRelevantStatus directive)
  
  **Note** : If you need to change the audit log engine configuration on a per-transaction basis (e.g., in response to some transaction data), use the ctl action.
  
  The following example demonstrates how SecAuditEngine is used:
  ```
  SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly
  SecAuditLog logs/audit/audit.log
  SecAuditLogParts ABCFHZ 
  SecAuditLogType concurrent 
  SecAuditLogStorageDir logs/audit 
  SecAuditLogRelevantStatus ^(?:5|4(?!04))
  ```
