Welcome to OWASP Coraza Web Application Firewall, Coraza is a golang enterprise-grade Web Application Firewall framework that supports Modsecurity's seclang language and is 100% compatible with OWASP Core Ruleset.

## Prerequisites

* Linux distribution (Debian and Centos are recommended, Windows is not supported yet)
* Golang compiler v1.16+


## Migrate from v1

* Rollback SecAuditLog to the legacy syntax (serial/concurrent)
* Attach an error log handler using ```waf.SetErrorLogCb(cb)``` (optional)
* the function Transaction.Clean() must be used to clear transaction data, files and take them back to the sync pool.
* If you are using @rx with libpcre (CRS) install the plugin [github.com/jptosso/coraza-pcre](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-pcre)
* If you are using low level APIs check the complete changelog as most of them were removed.


## Running the tests

Run the go tests:

```sh
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
```

## Coraza v2 differences with v1

* Full internal API refactor, public API has not changed
* Full audit engine refactor with plugins support
* New enhanced plugins interface for transformations, actions, body processors, and operators
* We are fully compliant with Seclang from modsecurity v2
* Many features removed and transformed into plugins: XML (Mostly), GeoIP and PCRE regex
* Better debug logging
* New error logging (like modsecurity)

## Your first Coraza WAF project

```go
package main
import(
	"fmt"
	"github.com/corazawaf/coraza/v2"
	"github.com/corazawaf/coraza/v2/seclang"
)

func main() {
	// First we initialize our waf and our seclang parser
	waf := coraza.NewWaf()
	parser, _ := seclang.NewParser(waf)

	// Now we parse our rules
	if err := parser.FromString(`SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@rx .*" "id:1,phase:1,deny,status:403"`); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}

	// Then we create a transaction and assign some variables
	tx := waf.NewTransaction()
	defer func(){
		tx.ProcessLogging()
		tx.Clean()
	}()
	tx.ProcessConnection("127.0.0.1", 8080, "127.0.0.1", 12345)

	// Finally we process the request headers phase, which may return an interruption
	if it := tx.ProcessRequestHeaders(); it != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Transaction was interrupted with status %d\n", it.Status)
	}
}
```

## Why Coraza WAF?

### Philosophy

* **Simplicity:** Anyone should be able to understand and modify Coraza WAF's source code
* **Extensibility:** It should be easy to extend Coraza WAF with new functionalities
* **Innovation:** Coraza WAF isn't just a ModSecurity port. It must include awesome new functions (in the meantime, it's just a port :sweat_smile:)
* **Community:** Coraza WAF is a community project, and all ideas will be considered


### Roadmap

* New rule language
* GraphQL body processor
* C exports
* WASM scripts support

## Coraza WAF implementations

* [Caddy Plugin (Reverse Proxy and Web Server)](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-caddy) (Stable)
* [Traefik Plugin (Reverse Proxy and Web Server)](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-traefik) (preview)
* [Gin Middleware (Web Framework)](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-gin) (Preview)
* [Buffalo Plugin (Web Framework)](#) (soon)
* [Coraza Server (HAPROXY, REST and GRPC)](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-server) (experimental)
* [Apache httpd](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-server) (experimental)
* [Nginx](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-server) (soon)
* [Coraza C Exports](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-cexport) (experimental)

## Some useful tools

* [Go FTW](https://github.com/fzipi/go-ftw): rule testing engine
* [Coraza Playground](https://playground.coraza.io/): rule testing sandbox with web interface
* [OWASP Core Ruleset](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/): Awesome rule set, compatible with Coraza
